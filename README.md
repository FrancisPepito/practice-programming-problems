<h3>Kriti's Birthday</h3>
Today is Kriti's birthday but I forgot to bring a grift for her. She is very angry with me. I have an idea for a gift. She likes coding very much. Why not give her a problem to solve as her gift?<p>
</br>
I know a problem but I am not sure whether its solvable or not.<p>
</br>
The problem initially has N strings numbered 1 to N. The program has to answer Q queries. Each query is of the form l r S. For each query, the program has to print the number of times the string S appears in the range[l,r]. Help me by solving the problem.<p>
</br>
<i>Input. </i>Input will begin with an integer N denoting the number of strings. N line follows each having a string. The next line contains Q denoting the number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contain a query of the form l r S.<p>
</br>
<i>Output. </i>For each query type l r S. print the answer to that query. Each answer must be in a new line.<p>

<h3>Maclaurin Series</h3>
The Maclaurin Series computes fo the approximation of a special Mathematical function. In this case, we have a Maclaurin series fot the actan(x) as a polynomial in x. The formula is: <p>
</br>
arctan(x)=x-x^3/3+x^5/5-x^7/7+x^9/9... <p>
</br>
Write a program that would read a double x, and a positive integer k, and prints out the partial sum from the first k terms in this series, and also prints the value of Math.atan(x) whic computes the arctangent correctly<p>

<h3>Number Pyramid></h3>
You are required to come up with a simple Mathematical expression that would have th following output:<p>
        1=9<p>
       12=98<p>
      123=987<p>
     1234=9876<p>
    12345=98765<p>
   123456=987654<p>
  1234567=9876543<p>
 12345678=98765432<p>
123456789=987654321
